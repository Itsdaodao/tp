### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Logic` component, because launching communication mode application through `UI` relies on `ApplicationLinkLauncher` to execute action.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.
* depends on the `Autocompletor` in `Logic` to provide suggestions while the user is typing.
* Keeps a reference to a `ReadOnlyCommandHistory` for use in accessing command history in the `CommandBox`

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

<div style = "page-break-after:always;"></div>
The sequence diagram below illustrates the typical interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("edit 1 n/Adam")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit 1 n\Adam` Command](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EditCommandParser` and `EditCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>


How the `Logic` component works in a typical case:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object.
1. The `AddressBookParser` calls upon the `CommandRegistry` to obtain a `CommandFactory` that creates a Command.
1. The `AddressBookParser` supplies the parsed arguments to the `CommandFactory`, which in turn uses the `EditParser`.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `EditCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to edit a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

#### State Management
The `Logic` component additionally relies on `State` to chiefly manage Confirmation prompts for some commands. In these cases, the components interact like so:

![State interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteAbstractedStateDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `DeleteCommand` and `ConfirmCommand` are both created in the respective `ref` frames directly above them. PlantUML does not allow for the object to be created in the frame.

</div>

How Logic manages State:

* Before parsing a Command, LogicManager checks its `State` to see if there is an operation pending confirmation.
* If there is no pending operation, the Logic Manager parses the input as per normal.
* If there is a pending operation, `LogicManager` calls upon `AddressBookParser` to strictly parse the input as a `ConfirmCommand`. `ConfirmCommand` will clear `State` via a callback once satisfied.
* After execution of a command, if the command returns a `ConfirmationPendingResult`, the LogicManager sets the `State` to await for the user's confirmation

#### Parsing
Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="700"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class queries `CommandRegistry` to find the appropriate `CommandFactory` instance that creates the corresponding `XYZCommandParser` class. (`XYZ`is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) Once found, the `CommandFactory` instance creates the `XYZCommandParser` class which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.

* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

#### Utility Classes

![How Logic Utility Classes Work](images/LogicUtilityClassDiagram.png)

How the utility classes work:
* Currently utility classes are only used by `PersonCard`, `LaunchCommand`, `LaunchCommandParser` and `MainWindow`
* `LaunchCommandParser` uses on `ApplicationType` to decide how it creates `LaunchCommand`
* When called upon by either `LaunchCommand` or `PersonCard`, `ApplicationLinkLauncher` uses the `ApplicationType` and attempts to launch the communication mode through the use `DesktopApi`.
* Based on the success of the `DesktopApi` launch attempt, `ApplicationLinkLauncher` will return with create and return the appropriate  `ApplicationLinkResult`.

#### How the Components work together (Find Command)

The sequence diagram below shows the full execution of the `FindCommand` in the `Logic` component.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find n\John Alex` Command](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered and sorted_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Pin/unpin feature

#### Overview

The Pin and Unpin feature allows users to prioritize important contacts by pinning them to the top of the contact list.
Pinned contacts remain visible at the top regardless of the current sort order (e.g., by name or by recency).
This feature enhances usability by making key contacts more accessible.

#### Rationale

In a large address book, users may need to frequently access certain contacts.
Instead of repeatedly searching for them, the pin feature provides a simple way to mark and elevate these contacts for quick access.
The unpin command restores a contact to its normal position in the list.

#### Design Considerations
- **Pinning Behavior**: When a contact is pinned, it should appear above all unpinned contacts in the displayed list.
- **Unpinning Behavior**: When a contact is unpinned, it returns to its original position relative to other unpinned contacts, based on the current sorting method.
- **Multiple Pins**: If multiple contacts are pinned, they are ordered among themselves based on their pin time (most recent first).
- **Persistence**: The pinned state (`isPinned` and `pinnedAt`) is stored in the address book data file so that it is retained across sessions.
- **Sorting Integration**: The feature is compatible with existing sorting options (e.g., name sort or recency sort). When the user applies any sort, the pin order is reapplied afterward to maintain consistency.

#### Implementation Details
- Each contact has an additional field indicating whether it is pinned, along with a timestamp representing when it was pinned.
- When the list is displayed, a sorting mechanism ensures that all pinned contacts are moved to the top, preserving the order of all other entries.
- The pin and unpin commands update the relevant contact and trigger a list refresh to reflect the new state immediately.
- The UI displays a visual indicator (such as a pin icon) beside pinned contacts to distinguish them clearly from unpinned ones.

#### Example Scenarios
1. **User pins a contact**: The contact immediately appears at the top of the list, along with other pinned contacts.
2. **User unpins a contact**: The contact moves back to its regular position according to the active sort order.
3. **User applies a name sort**: Contacts are sorted alphabetically, but pinned contacts remain above the rest.
4. **User exits and restarts the application**: Previously pinned contacts remain pinned as their state is saved in storage.

### Find persons by name or tag

#### Overview

The `find` command helps user quickly locate specific contacts by searching for keywords in their names or tags. It 
matches any contact where **at least one word** in the name or tag **begins with** a given keyword, making it easy 
to filter a large address book for relevant entries.

#### Rationale

As the address books grows, it's common to search for people based on partial names, initials, or tags (like 
`project` or `family`). Rather than scrolling and scanning, users can use the `find` command to instantly filter the 
list by starting letters or words.

#### Design Considerations
- **Word-based matching**: The search checks every word in the name or tag: if any word begins with a keyword, that 
  contact is returned.
- **Multiple keywords**: When multiple keywords are provided, a contact is included in the results if any of the 
  keywords matches the beginning of any word in the contacts's name or tag (an OR search).
- **Case-insensitive**: The matching ignores letter case for convenience.
- **Prefix flags**: Use `n\` for names or `t\` for tags. If both prefixes are provided, only the first prefix and 
  its keywords are used.
- **Sorting**: The results are displayed with index numbers for easy follow-up actions.

#### Implementation Details
- Each name or tag is split into words and checked against all supplied keywords.
- The search logic determines whether to search names or tags based on the first prefix entered (`n\` for names or 
  `t\` for tags). Only keywords following this prefix are considered, additional prefixes are ignored.
- Matches are shown as a numbered list, allowing for follow-up actions like editing or pinning.
- The command is compatible with all display sorting options: found contacts are listed in the current sorting mode.

#### Example Scenarios
1. **Find contacts by given name**: `find n\james` returns any contact whose name has a word starting with `james`, 
   like `James Ho` or `John jameson`.
2. **Find by tag**: `find t\friend` lists all contacts tagged with a word starting with "friend"
3. **Multiple keywords**: `find n\Alex Ann` finds any contact whose name contains a word starting with "Alex" or "Ann".
4. **Mixed prefixes**: `find n\Amy t\classmate` searches only for name matches with "Amy", ignoring the tag prefix.
