--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for DevBooks.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar devbooks.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n\Cheshire Doe p\98112321 e\cheshire@example.com l\cheshire_02 g\cheshire-dev` : Adds a contact named `Cheshire Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n\NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n\John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n\NAME [t\TAG]` can be used as `n\John Doe t\friend` or as `n\John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t\TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t\friend`, `t\friend t\family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n\NAME p\PHONE_NUMBER`, `p\PHONE_NUMBER n\NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</div>

### Switching Modes
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about switching modes:**<br>

* Commands listed in the "Switching Modes" section are *global* - they don't need to be inserted into the Command Box.

* `<Esc>` refers to the *escape key* on the keyboard.

* Switching to scroll mode *does not clear pending state* - if you have a pending operation (e.g. deletion), you must confirm the operation upon switching back to insert mode.  
</div>

#### Insert Mode: `i`

Insert mode is the mode the application starts in. It allows you to send commands in the Command Box.

Switch back to insert mode by pressing `i`.

#### Entering Scroll mode: `<Esc>`

Scroll mode allows you to navigate entries in the application without leaving the home row. Scroll mode disables
input to the Command Box, but don't worry about forgetting how to go back to insert mode - a helpful hint is shown
every time you enter scroll mode.

Enter scroll mode by pressing `<Esc>`

##### Navigating down: `j`

Press `j` to select the entry below the current entry.

##### Navigating up: `k`

Press `k` to select the entry above the current entry.


### Launching external communication modes : `launch`

Launches a browser to communicate with the specified person via the specified mode.

Scope: launching the browser with the correct link specified below.

Format: `launch INDEX [-l (Telegram) | -g (GitHub)]`

* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Use the flag to specify the communication mode:
    * `-l` launches browser with the formatted link `https://t.me/HANDLE`, whereby handle should be the specified contact's Telegram handle,
        * Do note, to open the chat through web browser, the user is required to have Telegram application installed on their device. (i.e. send button does not allow redirecting Telegram web)
          * However, the ability to check with is also beyond the scope of this feature.
        * Additionally, checking existence of Telegram user is outside the scope of this feature and is handled by Telegram application.
    * `-g` launches browser with the formatted link `https://github.com/USERNAME`, whereby username should be the specified contact's GitHub username,
        * Checking existence of GitHub user is outside the scope of this feature and is handled by GitHub.
* User must specify **exactly one flag**.
* If the person does not have the specified communication mode, an error message is shown.
* User's interaction with the launched application is outside the scope of this feature.
* User's can also launch external application through the GUI by left-clicking the Telegram or GitHub links of a person in the person card.


Examples:
* `launch 3 -l` launches browser with the formatted link `https://t.me/HANDLE`, with `HANDLE` as the  Telegram handle of the 3rd person's in the displayed person list (given they have a Telegram Handle).
* `launch 1 -g` launches browser with the formatted link `https://github.com/USERNAME`, with the `USERNAME` as the GitHub username of the 1st person in the displayed person list (given they have a GitHub username).

**Important Notes:**
* The launch command has only been tested on the following operating systems.
    * Windows
    * MAC
    * LINUX (ARCH)
    * LINUX (FEDORA)
* Your mileage with this feature might vary if your operating system is not one stated above.
* Kindly refer to [Known Issues: 2](#known-issues) to see more about the limitations

### Saving the data

There is no need to save manually as the AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically **ONLY after any command that changes the data**.
* Commands that change the data include: `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `pin`, `unpin`, `tag` and `clear`.
* Commands that do not change the data include: `help`, `list`, `find`, `launch`, and `exit`.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you are not using one of listed Operating System(OS)**, then `launch` command may not work as expected. Whilst our implementation attempts to use system-specific command to launch the application first, its fallback mechanism uses the java.awt.Desktop api **IF AVAILABLE**. However, linux support with the java.awt libraries is already tenuous at best as it provides inconsistent behaviour between the different distros. Hence, kindly note that if your OS is not one stated in the list, the launch function may function inconsistently.
3. **Unaccounted changes in the AddressBook if its addressbook.json file is edited whilst the application is running.** This is mainly as a result of how we handle when the reading and [saving of data](#saving-the-data) is triggered. As a result we are unable to detect changes to the addressbook.json file during the run time of the application and any direct changes made to this file whilst the application is running will be **OVERWRITTEN if [saving of data](#saving-the-data) is triggered.** Hence, the user should **NOT** edit the addressbook.json file while the application is in use.
